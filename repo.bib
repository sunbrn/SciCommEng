abstract="Many repositories of open data for genomics, collected by world-wide consortia, are important enablers of biological research; moreover, all experimental datasets leading to publications in genomics must be deposited to public repositories and made available to the research community. These datasets are typically used by biologists for validating or enriching their experiments; their content is documented by metadata. However, emphasis on data sharing is not matched by accuracy in data documentation; metadata are not standardized across the sources and often unstructured and incomplete.",

abstract="Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a new technology to study genome-wide long-range chromatin interactions bound by protein factors. Here we present ChIA-PET Tool, a software package for automatic processing of ChIA-PET sequence data, including linker filtering, mapping tags to reference genomes, identifying protein binding sites and chromatin interactions, and displaying the results on a graphical genome browser. ChIA-PET Tool is fast, accurate, comprehensive, user-friendly, and open source (available at                   http://chiapet.gis.a-star.edu.sg                                  ).",
